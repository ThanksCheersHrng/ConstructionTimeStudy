# ConstructionTimeStudy
How accurate can your quotes on time be for each construction project? 
## Motivation 
Time is money; this adage is well-understood in industry. Your clients want quotes and, if the project is big enough, the locals want to know how long they'll have to deal with these traffic lights. Using the free dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claytonmiller/construction-and-project-management-example-data/data, I'm setting out to explore what factors contribute to the longest construction time frames. If the data structure is there, I may be able to create a better formula for calculating construction time, to help project managers and consultants present better quotes. And of course, this comes with the caveat of data distribution: there may be a central tendency to the data (e.g. "on average, it takes X project type Y weeks to complete."), but there is also, always, a variance (e.g. "Y is the average, but X project type hits a range of 50% less or 50% more than Y). If the variance is large, there may be an argument for each of the following two approaches to price quoting: 
* Quote them the average, but charge them what the project actually costs at the end of the day
* Quote and charge them the average, on the expectation that for some projects you'll lose money, and for others, you'll gain.

... but that decision is another project entirely. :)
